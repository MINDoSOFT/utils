% function [P R ap acc maxAcc cM iu] = calcPR(gt, out, wt)
% Function to calculate the precision, recall, ap, accuracy (at all thresholds), maximum accuracy and confusion matrix at point of maximum accuracy for a binary class problem.
% Input:
% gt is the ground truth for each point. It should be between 0 and 1. Values between 0 and 1 are treated as how correct you think the gt is (for example for super pixels how much of a superpixel belongs to the corerct class. 
% out is the score for the ith point.
% wt is the weight for each point (for example for superpixels it might be the area of the super pixel).
% Output:
% P is the precision
% R is the recall at the corresponding precision value
% ap is the average precision
% acc is the corresponding accuracy for the precision and recall values
% maxAcc is the maximum accuracy over all the thresholds
% cM is the confusion matrix for the 2 class problem at the point at which there is maximum accuracy.
% iu is the intersection over union for all the thresholds..
